### How do You Improve
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving
- Uderstand the problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it down
- Solve/ Simplify
- Look Back And Refactor

### 1. Uderstand the problem
- Can I restate the proble in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problems? 
- What are the outputs that should come from the soution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined fro the inputs? In other words, do I have enougn information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question untill you set about solving the problem. Thats okay; its still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
- How should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 

### 2. Explore Concrete Examples
- Start with Simple Examples
- Progress to more Conplex Examples
- Explore examples with Empty inputs
- Explore examples with Invalid inputs

### 3. Break it down
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
- This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstanding before you dive in and have to worry about details.(e.g. language syntax) as well.

### 4. Solve The Problem `if you can't` Solve A Simpler Problem
#### Simplify: 
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in
